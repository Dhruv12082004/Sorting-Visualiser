🔢 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work step by step.
This project helps in understanding the internal mechanics of sorting algorithms through real-time animations.

🚀 Features

Visualizes sorting algorithms with animated bars

Adjustable array size and sorting speed

Generates random arrays dynamically

Clean and responsive UI

Easy comparison between different algorithms

🧠 Algorithms Implemented

🔹 Bubble Sort

🔹 Selection Sort

🔹 Insertion Sort

🔹 Quick Sort

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling & animations

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic & visualization

⚙️ How It Works

A random array is generated and displayed as vertical bars

Each bar’s height represents its value

During sorting:

Colors indicate comparisons and swaps

Heights change dynamically to show sorting progress

Sorting completes when bars are in ascending order
